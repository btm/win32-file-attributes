== Description
  Additional methods for the File class that relate to file properties
  on the Microsoft Windows operating system.

== Prerequisites
  * ffi

== Installation
  gem install win32-file-attributes

== Synopsis

  require 'win32/file/attributes

  p File.hidden?(file)    # => false
  p File.attributes(file) # => ['archive', 'indexed']

== Notes
  If you have the win32-file gem already installed then you do not need this
  gem. This library was split out from the win32-file gem in order to ease
  testing and maintenance.

  Otherwise, the only difference is that this library uses FFI instead
  of win32-api. This also means that it works with JRuby.

== Known issues or bugs
  None that I'm aware of.
